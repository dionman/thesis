This work contains the outcomes of several years of research endeavours which would not have been accomplished without my interaction with many outstanding collegues. I express my deep gratitude to my supervisor, Cecilia Mascolo, for generously granting me vast stretches of freedom in my research, her unabated trust in my work, and her courageous support and mentorship over the ups and downs of my PhD. I'm also grateful to Trevor Campbell for his bold and stimulating collaboration: my perspective on science has been largely benefited by his adherence to first principles and his enthousiasm on research. My close collaboration with Alastair Beresford was most valuable over the time I started delving into the subject of data privacy. I'm thankful to my labmates at the Mobile Systems Group, Nokia Bell Labs, Max Planck Institute, and the rest of my collaborators:
Sourav Bhattacharya, Dennis Chan, Abir De, Manuel Gomez Rodriguez, Fahim Kawsar, Nic Lane,  Akhil Mathur, Alberto Gil Ramos, Rik Sarkar, Nikhil Sharma, Stylianos Venieris and Zuheng Xu. My warm thanks to Michael Schaub and Kostas Kyriakopoulos: their mentorship over my earlier years in academia, provided me with solid foundations which were substantial over my PhD. Thanks to
Mattias Grossglauser and Amanda Prorok for serving as the members of my examing committee.

I gratefully acknowledge the financial support received from Nokia Bell Labs, Lundgren Fund, Darwin College Cambridge, and the Department of Computer Science \& Technology that backed my research. 

Antonis, Jenny and Panos made my time enjoyable supporting me with their friendship at all times. Finally, my deepest thanks to Mum, Dad and Lena for giving me a life of unconditional love and support.
