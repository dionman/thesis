\epigraph{%One should wait, and gather meaning and sweetness a whole life long, a long life if possible, and then, at the very end, one might perhaps be able to write ten good lines. 
	In order to write a single line, one must see a great many cities, people and things, have an understanding of animals, sense how it is to be a bird in flight, and know the manner in which the little flowers open every morning. In one's mind there must be regions unknown, meetings unexpected and long-anticipated partings, to which one can cast back one's thoughts---childhood days that still retain their mystery,~[\dots] days in peacefully secluded rooms and mornings beside the sea, and the sea itself, seas, nights on journeys that swept by on high and flew past filled with stars~[\dots]~And it is not yet enough to have memories~[\dots]~Only when they become the very blood within us, our every look and gesture, nameless and no longer distinguishable from our inmost self, only then, in the rarest of hours,~[\dots]~can the first word arise in their midst and go out among them.}{\textit{Rainer Maria Rilke\\ The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge~\\(translated by Michael Hulse)}}
