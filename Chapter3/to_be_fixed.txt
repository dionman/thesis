We just started processing all submissions and experienced several
issues with yours.  First, I get the following error:

! LaTeX Error: Unknown option `subsection' for package `placeins'.

I looked at the latest documentation of placeins and it doesn't seem to
support a "subsection" parameter.  All I could find is a "section"
parameter:
<http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/placeins/placeins-doc.pdf>

Once I replaced "subsection" with "section", the next issue is that you
use the inputenc package twice, with difference encodings, which seems
to raise another error:

! LaTeX Error: Option clash for package inputenc.

Finally, my LaTeX compiler tells me that subfig and subcaption are
incompatible with each other, raising another error:

! Package subcaption Error: This package can't be used in cooperation
(subcaption)                with the subfig package.
